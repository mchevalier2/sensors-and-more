## Context

This data analysis and visualition project was triggered by a [data-upskilling](https://benjamin-dubreu.systeme.io/programme-data-upskilling) training course I recently followed to acquaint myself with tools commonly used by data scientists. With this project, I used and combined all the different concepts I learned in the class.


**Note**: This project is not about the data illustrated in the final streamlit app. It is all about showcasing my capacity at creating a robust infrasture and data processing pipeline.



## The general idea

==test==



This project will follow five different routes:
1. Creating an API that generates data
2. A python script to collect data
3. A python script combining SQL techniques to transform the data.
4. A visualisation App with streamlit
5. An Airflow DAG to automatise the data update.

Let's get started.

## The details


### Creating the data


### Accessing the data remotely


### Processing the data


### Analysing and visualising
